OSGL (open source games list) is a list of open source games, game frameworks and game creation tools. The projects are at least in beta stage with a
code basis that builds into an executable demo. The code must be under a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS)
license that allows modification and sharing by others. For each entry, relevant information is collected regarding
code repositories, download possibilities and build instructions.

### Background

I love open source projects and games and I am interested in learning more about building systems.
I see the following benefits of having this database.

- General information about open source games
- Possibility of improving build instructions on the projects side (not all projects actually have build instructions)
- Revival of abandoned games that do not build anymore
- Conversion of old repository formats like CVS to Git
